## Battle Frontier - Minigame ##
Teams:
3-5 people. 3min and 5max, unless a staff wants to join.

Gameplay:
Each person get to pick 1 of 3 kits to play with. Each kit has an upgrade and an ability. (Upgrades: Starter, normal, pro, and legend)

Upgrade:
Every kit can be upgraded to be stronger. While it upgrades there is a time on the upgrade. You can either wait for the time to finish or you can use "credits" to speed it up.
Every 10 minutes can be sped up with 1 credit.

How to start:
It starts of in a more or less mineplex game lobby, but is different in many ways of how to pick a class. After the game gets 6 players a 30 second timer goes off, once it runs out people get evenly split and tp'ed to their base.

Base/HQ:
Each base has a power core. People of each team respawn inside the power core, but if the power core is destroyed then a team can no longer respawn.

Respawn:
Respawn time:12 seconds (if a core is destroyed while a player is already in respawn "mode" he can still respawn at the end of the time)

How to destroy a power core:
Each power core has a shield protecting it. To disable the shield the team must capture the capture point (in middle of map). If the capture point is taken back then the people that are destroying the power core start to get hurt. The power core has 5k health. (It has a hologram above it saying &5&lPOWER CORE, then one space under &c[&e#/5000&c] 

Capture point:
The capture point takes 24 second to take if there is 1 person on it. If 2-4 then it takes 16 seconds. If 5+ then 8 seconds.


End:
The game ends once a power core is destroyed and all the players of the team die. Also if no one wins in 20 minutes it's a force tie.

Rank perks:
If you are knight+ you can spec the game after it has started.
If you are king+ they you get to play game 3 weeks befor out to all.
If you are emperor+ you get to join full games, even if it's a 5 on 5.

Rewards:
1 kill=2D
Power core destroy=50D

Scoreboard:
The score board shows both teams health and who is controlling the capture point. If a power cord is getting attacked then players of that team get "screen words" telling them about it with an anvil breaking sound when the text comes to them. (Only the team that's power core is getting attacked)
